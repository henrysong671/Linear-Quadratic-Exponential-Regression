- MatPlotLib

Usage:
- open terminal and navigate to containing
- run 'python3 main.py' in terminal
- select 1 to use hard-coded data set, select 2 to manually enter data set
- select 1 to use linear regression, 2 to use quadratic regression, 3 to use exponential regression, 4 to use logarithmic regression
- results and predictions will be displayed
