# Linear-Quadratic-Exponential-Regression

Python program designed to utilize linear, quadratic and/or exponential regression methods to produce a corresponding formula and a 5-unit prediction. Both 
linear and quadratic regression methods use linear algebra, specifically Cramer's Rule, to calculate formulas.

Dependencies:
- NumPy
- MatPlotLib

Usage:
- open terminal and navigate to containing
- run 'python3 main.py' in terminal
- select 1 to use hard-coded data set, select 2 to manually enter data set
- select 1 to use linear regression, 2 to use quadratic regression, 3 to use exponential regression
- results and predictions will be displayed
